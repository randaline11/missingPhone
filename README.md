# missingPhone

Check out the other branch for more commits :)
This project was designed by project MakeStuff at Dartmouth's Digital Arts Leadership and Innovation Lab. 
The idea is as follows:
1. The user enters a booth constructed for one perosn. Inside is a phone and a screen depicting a video.
2. The user watches the video until a qr code is displayed on the screen. The user is instructed to scan the qr code with the phone.
3. The qr code leads the user to interesting content. Meanwhile, the video changes.
4. When the user looks up again, she notices she has missed the most important part of the video because she was on the phone. The video reverts back to normal and the user is shown a quick description of the project and what it's meant to represent.
5. The booth is ready to support the next user.
